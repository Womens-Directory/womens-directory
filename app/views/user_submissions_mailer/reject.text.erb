Hello from Women's Directory,

Sorry, but we've chosen not to add your <%= 'submission'.pluralize @records.count %> for <%= @records.map {|r| "#{r.class}: #{r.name}"}.join(', ') %> to the website.

<% if @reason %>
<%= @reason %>

<% end %>
We appreciate your help, but due to our limited scope, we can't always add every organization or location to our site.

Please contact us if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Women's Directory
